# Neural Network For Classifying Electroencephalography(EEG) Data

A deep learning model for processing and classifying EEG data. EEG data contains information about millions of neuron's activity within the brain. 
The dataset can be found at: https://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/. More information on the dataset is located at: https://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/desc_2a.pdf.

The data was taken via electrodes connecting to the scalp of the head and recorded four seperate tasks: Movement of the left hand, right hand, both feet, and tonque.
Therefore, our main goal is to accurately classifying the EEG into one of the four classes.
